# faiss-face-retrieval
A deep learning project combining VGG16 embeddings, XGBoost classification, and FAISS for face recognition and retrieval.

This project explores an innovative approach to face recognition by combining:

VGG16 for deep feature extraction,
XGBoost for classification, and
FAISS for fast similarity-based retrieval.
